### AUTO GRUB CHANGER
## Script to Change your Grub Theme
This is a simple script I created to change the grub theme and I attached a pacman hook to do it when I update my system.


## What it does
I have this to change my grub theme automatically from the selection I have in the boot/grub/themes directory
Make sure to change the directory you keep the script in on the pacman hook.
## Why

Cause it's a nice spice of flavour while you are using grub.
